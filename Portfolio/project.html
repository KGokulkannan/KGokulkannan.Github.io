    <h3>YOUTUBE TRANSCRIPT SUMMARIZER</h3>
    <p>Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the Internet throughout the day. In
            today's daily lifestyle, it has become really difficult to spend time watching such videos which may have a
            longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if we couldn't find relevant
            information out of it as most of the videos are been uploading to grab the attention of the viewers by tricking
            or misleading the viewers by thumbnails, advertisements, etc. As the number of users of YouTube are
            increasing rapidly from year to year, this may directly impact the number of videos to be created. In greed for
            the number of views, the chance that the creators of the videos may give wrong information on the original
            content of the video is probably very high. This may waste the valuable time and resources of the user.
            An automatic YouTube transcript summarizer is a tool that generates a summary of the content in a YouTube
            video by analyzing the transcript of the video's audio. This is a useful tool for users who want to quickly
            understand the main points of a video without having to watch the entire video. In this paper, we present a
            system for automatically summarizing YouTube transcripts using natural language processing and machine
            learning techniques. Our system is based on a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of YouTube
            transcripts and is able to accurately and efficiently extract the main points and key information from the
            transcript. Our results show that our system is able to provide concise and accurate summaries of YouTube
            videos.</p>
